# wikidata-confederates
Data from Wikidata for Confederate generals and politicians, to use to see if there are any things near you named for them. The goal is to get them renamed.

I'm compiling these from Wikidata, via the WDumper tool: https://tools.wmflabs.org/wdumps/dumps. Here is more info on the dumps: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_download

The raw data is kind of complicated so I am going to post that in case someone wants to parse it, as well as a parsed version 

The queries are as follows:

P27: country of citizenship - Confederate States of America
P241: military branch - Confederate States of America army
P410: military rank - generals in the Confederate Army
